temp-converter: a Farenheit-Celcius converter PyGTK app
=======================================================

### Warning!! ###
This is only my first attempt at building a PyGTK app, therefore it's as bare and simple as it gets.

### Required libraries ###
* python-gtk2, Python's GTK bindings.
* python-nose, for running test suite.
* glade, for building the UI.

### How to run it ###

* On a *nix system:
  1. Make the main.py file executable - chmod +x main.py
  2. Execute the main.py file.

* On Windows:
  1. Install Python.
  2. Install PyGTK.
  3. Run the main.py file from the PyGTK console.
